        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Spirituality is a separate entity to Religion, it is more like a feeling or frame of mind. As Carl Sagan put it:</p>
            <p class="quote">”Science is not only compatible with spirituality, it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty and subtlety of life then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.”</p>
            <p>A purely rational person can also be a spiritual person, it comes from a profound realization of ones place in the universe, and the incredibility that anything even exists at all.</p>
            <p>One of the major ideas in spirituality and philosophy is that the sense of self is an illusion. That pervasive “I” that you feel, that sense of being an experiencer, a passenger inside your body, inside your head peering out through your eyes is an illusion. Everything that you experience, your emotions, thoughts, impulses are all delivered by processes spread out across the brain. We are ever changing and there isn’t a unified self that’s carried through each moment, even though we feel as though that is the case.</p>
            <p>Trying to recognize what experience is like without the sense of self is possible and it what is usually termed as “Self Transcendence” or “Enlightenment”. The main method of finding this that is covered in this book is Mindfulness Meditation. Mindfulness is drawing all of your focus into the present moment and letting go of your thoughts and emotions, sounds easy right? Anyone that has actually sat down and tried to <em>stop thinking</em> will know that this is one of the most difficult things to do. Thoughts are constantly arising and we are always chasing them, carrying around this internal conversation with ourselves. Being lost in thought is conditioned deeply within us and the root of much human suffering. Though the problems aren’t the thoughts themselves but the fact that we are thinking without being aware that we are thinking. Being lost in thought usually entails us being concerned with the recent past, or envisioning a better future.</p>
            <p>The genuine experience of happiness boils down to our focus being in the present moment. Our culture has programmed our minds to delay our happiness into the near future, achieving that next goal and getting that next reward. But this feeling is fleeting and we move on to getting the next thing that will bring us happiness. This always brings to mind the classic carrot-on-the-stick principle.</p>
            <p class="quote">”The reality of your life is always now, and to realize this is liberating. In fact, I think there is nothing more important to understand if you want to be happy in this world.”</p>
            <p>With some practice in meditation you can become aware of the state of experience between these thoughts appearing, and observe the appearing thoughts without judgement and let them drift away - clearing the mind. This practice can break the spell of negative emotions, for example anger. If you become angry you tend to stay angry, but this involves us actively reproducing the feeling of anger. We do this by constantly thinking over our reasons for being angry, thus feeding the feeling of anger and chasing it along without noticing. This is not to say that meditation will cure you of feeling negative emotions ever again, but you can learn not to feel them for very long. With a shift of attention you can alter your state of mind completely. Imagine feeling depressed, but then you are brought to laughter by something someone said. That feeling of depression was lost from that momentary shift in focus, if you train your mind to detach from your thoughts and emotions you can let go of them when they are causing suffering.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of reasons to incorporate meditation into a daily practice. I would even say a brief meditation break weighs in as important as daily exercise, a healthy diet and a good sleep schedule.</p>
            <p class="quote">”A review of psychological literature suggests that mindfulness specifically aids in many components of physical and mental health: It improves immune functions, blood pressure and cortisol levels. It reduces anxiety, depression, neuroticism and emotional reactivity. Unsurprisingly the practice is associated with increased subjective well being.”</p>
            <p>So not only is meditation paramount in understanding the mind, and what the human experience is like, but also a powerful tool for your well being and overall a better subjective experience. It does require discipline and commitment, but all good things do. Just as you need to work out regularly for a while to receive the fruits of your labor or practice an instrument for years to be able to play it well.</p>
            <p class="quote">”Once one recognizes the selflessness of consciousnesses, the practice of meditation becomes just a means of getting more familiar with it. The goal, thereafter, is to cease to overlook what is already the case. Paradoxically, this still requires discipline, and setting aside time for meditation is indispensable. But the true discipline is to remain committed, throughout the whole of one’s life, to waking up from the dream of the self. Consciousness is the basis of both the examined and unexamined life. It is all that can be seen and all that does the seeing. No matter how far you have traveled from your place of birth, and however much you now understand about the world, you have been exploring consciousness and its changes. Why not do so directly?”</p>
