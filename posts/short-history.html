        <div class="post-content">
            <p>The title gives away what to expect with this book, over 500 pages of scientific fun facts about everything from the Big Bang to modern civilization. Bill Bryson writes in a such an easy-to-digest and humourous manner that makes the content fun and available to anyone. It would be impossible to trim down this book into a summary as I usually do as it is already a trimmed down compilation of immense information, So I’ll leave you some of the most entertaining snippets.</p>
            <p>Depending on where you are on Earth depends on the speed at which you are travelling (spinning with the Earth). Speeds at about 1,600km/h at the equator and 0 at the poles.</p>
            <p>If you think you’re an unlucky person, be thankful you’re not this unlucky! A man named Guillaume Le Gentil set off from France in 1760 heading to India to measure the transit of Venus - to triangulate the distance of Earth from the Sun. However due to numerous setbacks he was still at sea at the time of the transit in 1761. Lucky for him that another transit would be in 8 years (There are 2 transits - 8 years apart, then over a century until they return). During the 8 year wait Le Gentil set up a first class viewing platform with all the equipment required, tested and ready. On the morning of the second transit, 4th of June 1769, He awoke to a perfect day; but just as the transit began a cloud blocked his view of the Sun that persisted for the exact duration of the transit (three hours, fourteen minutes and seven seconds). Stoically, Le Gentil packed up his equipment and headed for the port to go back to France however along the way contracted dysentery - leaving him bed ridden for another year. Once he was healthy enough to travel (still very weakened from illness) he boarded his ship home, which was almost wrecked in a hurricane off the African coast. When he finally made it home alive eleven years later, having achieved nothing, he discovered that his relatives had declared him dead in his absence and enthusiastically plundered his estate.</p>
            <p>In 1781 William Herschel became the first person in the modern era to discover a planet (planets were likely identified throughout history - but unofficially until Herschel). He wanted to call it George but was over ruled and it is now known as Uranus.</p>
            <p>A rusting object doesn’t lose weight but gains weight by attracting elemental particles from the air. This discovery led to the understanding that all matter cannot be destroyed or created, only transformed - known as the conservation of mass. If you burned a book <strong>(blasphemy!)</strong> its matter would become ash and smoke but the net total of “stuff” in the universe would remain the exact same.</p>
            <p>The confusion over the spelling of Aluminium arose from the indecisiveness of it’s discoverer Humphry Davy. When he first isolated the element in 1808 he named it <em>Alumium</em>, but for some reason four years later decided against that name and changed it to <em>Aluminum</em>. Americans dutifully adopted this term but the British disliked it going against the suffix ‘-ium’ that followed many other elements and so began referring to it as <em>Aluminium</em>.</p>
            <p>Most of the heat of the Earth comes from radioactive decay within the mantle and crust - a whopping 44<sup>12</sup> watts (44 trillion)! This is about six times the power consumption of the United States.</p>
            <p>Atoms, the building blocks behind everything in existence, are <em>tiny</em>. They’re so tiny in fact that half a million atoms lined up shoulder to shoulder could hide behind the width of a human hair. If you wanted to view an atom with the naked eye, you would have to take a single drop of water and enlarge it until it was <em>24 kilometres</em> across. Not only are they super tiny, they’re also super abundant. Breathable air is made up of two oxygen atoms (creating one oxygen molecule) - at sea level and at 0 degrees Celsius if you were to count all the oxygen molecules within one cubic centimetre (1cm<sup>3</sup> roughly a sugar cube) you would find 45 billion billion molecules (45<sup>18</sup> or 45 with 18 zeroes!).</p>
            <p class="quote">”Bear in mind that one atom is to a millimeter line as the thickness of a sheet of paper is to the height of the Empire State Building”</p>
            <p>Nitrous Oxide was discovered in 1772 by an English chemist Joseph Preistley, however it’s uses weren’t known at this time and it was primarily used as a recreational drug in which people would host “Laughing Gas Parties” and theatre performances in which the actors would inhale N<sub>2</sub>O and perform sketches under the influence. It wasn’t until 1844 that the Anaesthetic use was implemented, and not until the mid 1900’s that it’s use in rocket engines, internal combustion engines and aerosol propellants was discovered.</p>
            <p>The Romans used to sweeten their wine with lead! During the fermentation process the Romans preferred to use lead containers and they produced a sweeter flavour (due to the lead seeping into the wine). Because a typical Roman may drink a litre of wine a day - they would also ingest up to 20mg of lead with that wine.</p>
            <p>If you imagine the 4.6 billion years of the Earths age compressed into a 24 hour day - life begins at 4am, with the rise of single celled organisms. But then there are no advances for 16 hours (that’s right, for a few billion years life didn’t seem all that ambitious to be anything more than to simply exist), not until about 8:30pm did Earth have anything to show off that was more complex than microbes. Then some sea plants started to appear, twenty minutes later followed some jellyfish, at 9:04pm trilobites started swimming about. Just before 10pm plants managed to appear on the land and shortly after, with only 2 hours left in the day, did the first land animals crawl about. By 10:24pm the Earth is covered in carboniferous forests and a smattering of insects. Dinosaurs jump onto the scene just before 11pm and reign for about 40 minutes until 11:39pm where they’re wiped out and the mammals can rise up. Finally at 11:59pm humans rise up, and <em>all</em> of our recorded history is no more than a few measly seconds on this timescale.</p>
            <p>You have nearly 2 metres of DNA inside every cell in your body. Each strand contains almost 3.2 billion letters of coding which is enough to provide 10<sup>1,920,000,000</sup> possible combinations (that’s a one followed by more than three billion zeroes - it would take more than five thousand average sized books to print that figure). If all of your DNA were woven into a single strand, there would be enough to stretch from Earth to Pluto and back, then to Pluto again - Pluto being about 7.5 billion kilometres away and all of your DNA reaching about 20 billion kilometres.</p>
            <p>Marine organisms use carbon dioxide to make their shells, by trapping the carbon dioxide in sea shells it is prevented from building up in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. So an abundance of marine life is paramount to preventing catastrophic global warming, a problem here is commercial fishing. For every 1kg of shrimp caught, more than 4kg of other marine life is killed from being caught up in the net.</p>
            <p>We are very lucky to be here. “We” being every living thing, to be a part of a planet with such an abundance of life is an astounding feat. Nowhere in the universe have we seen anything quite like it and while it seems statistically probable that there must be more life out there somewhere, we have yet to find any evidence to suggest so. Not only that but it’s absolutely incredible that we are at such an advanced level of intelligence that we can be aware of the fact that we’re surrounded by such miracles and can experience anything at all. Modern humans have been around for less than 0.01% of the entire age of the Earth. We’re very young and have quite a lot of advancing, improving and problems to endure if we are to survive.</p>
            <p>Every iota of the universe holds a plethora of fascinating information, if you were to grab a handful of soil from the ground underneath your feet that soil would contain over a million yeasts, two hundred thousand moulds, ten thousand protozoans and other microscopic critters such as cryptozoa - a handful of dirt is far more incredible than you often think! Everything that exists can be interesting if you’re curious enough, let that curiosity flourish in your mind and learn an interesting fact about the world every day. The more you understand the deeper your appreciation runs, and if everyone were a little more appreciative of the fact that they can exist right now the world would be an even better place.</p>
