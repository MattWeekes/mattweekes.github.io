        <div class="post-content">
            <p>This book tackles one of the deepest of human problems - what happens when you die? It opens by posing the question “where were you before you were born?”, which everyone will answer differently but of course there’s no true answer other than “I don’t know”. Is an afterlife, reincarnation or immortality real when there is no evidence for them and no one has ever returned to tell us otherwise?</p>
            <p>Michael Shermer, as a scientist and a skeptic, picks apart each perspective as he explains them - where does heaven exist, what is the soul and how does it work, how do souls keep up with the rapidly growing population etc. But these are all valid questions one must ask when facing such spiritual and metaphysical beliefs, being skeptical and critical are important traits on the path of discovery.</p>
            <p>The first approach is from the perspective of religion. Most people believe in an afterlife and these statistics are higher when you ask people approaching death such as the terminally ill or death row inmates. But why is it so widely believed if there’s no real evidence of anything post death? It could be for comfort, knowing that experience will come to an end and the human mind cannot fathom nothingness or infinity and that death seems to imply both. Does heaven exist, and if so which idea of heaven is it? Each religion paints a different picture of an afterlife. Those born from desert dwelling societies describe heaven as an oasis with flowing water, cool breezes and bountiful fruit trees whereas other religions simply describe heaven as a replica of Earth but without the “bad parts” (natural disasters, predation, war etc). Then there’s religions that don’t have a heaven but the afterlife is a form of reincarnation where the soul gets placed into another physical body to experience life over.</p>
            <p>The second perspective is the scientific search for immortality. Some people claim that what you experience during a Near Death Experience (NDE) or Out Of Body experience (OBE) proves an afterlife. During an OBE you seem to leave your physical body and float around in a kind of limbo where you witness the physical world externally. Most commonly experienced close to sleep or in congruence with a NDE, some people claim to have left their physical body and watched themselves be revived by medics. However these descriptions are vague and general recollections of what someone would guess such as CPR and defibrillation. Some people have claimed during a NDE to have visited heaven and contacted Angels. All these descriptions of heaven are very different and obviously some form of personal manifestation of what they perceive heaven to be, but they do follow a very general guide which happens to be uncannily similar to what is described during psychedelic experiences. This is a main point in the “DMT is released by the brain” hypothesis (but that’s a different topic). These experiences, while you certainly can <em>seem</em> to leave your physical body, visit heaven and contact Angels (or any entity), are created by the brain and aren’t evidence of a form of afterlife. There have been experiments on peoples recollection of the OBE where a poster was placed on top of a cabinet facing the roof unbeknown to the subject (so it was only visible from the roof) and when someone experienced an OBE was asked about the poster - if it existed and to describe it, which they could not do.</p>
            <p>The approach of scientists trying to overcome death is found in the fields of mind uploading, cryonics and nanobots.</p>
            <p>Mind uploading is an approach to upload your consciousness, memories, personality etc into a robot or computer enabling you to essentially live forever. The problem with this approach is even if (or when) it is possible to do so, your point of view experience doesn’t continue over into the computer, it is merely a copy of your self. You will live on in your biological body, but now there will also be a computer “you” in existence too. From the point of its creation it will become a different self, creating different memories and experiences, especially because as a computer it won’t have the biological desires that drive a humans wants and needs - it won’t be driven by hunger, thirst, fatigue, sex and emotions.</p>
            <p>Cryonics is the process of freezing a human to preserve the neurons storing our memories and personality. The simple explanation is that you would be frozen for an amount of time (until technological advances can make you immortal) then unfrozen being completely preserved, essentially waking up from a long sleep similar to anaesthesia. The problem is that this is very far off. While scientists can freeze brains there are many issues in this, a main one being “icing” where ice forms over the neurons during the freezing or defrosting process shattering those neurons.</p>
            <p>Nanobots come in when we advance technology enough to create computers the size of a single cell. If we are capable of this then we could ingest a bunch of nanobots to repair our bodies by navigating our blood stream to clear pathogens, debris, clots, clogs, tumors, repair damaged DNA and essentially stop the aging process. If nanobots can actually do this then you could live forever, until you encountered a fatal accident. This would be the most ideal choice for immortality so far as your point of view experience continues on, and it’s that sense of self that you identify with to want to live on.</p>
            <p>The third part touches on the creation of utopia on Earth. This has been attempted many times throughout history, the problem is that the ideal “heaven on Earth” to one person or group doesn’t mirror to the totality of humanity. When they start working towards making their ideal a reality, they gain support from those of a similar mind and opposition from those that disagree and as long as there’s a disagreement among people how can there be a true utopia? At this point it can become dangerous, once this group becomes attached to making their ideology a reality and if they have some power behind them, whether it be political or arsenal (or both) they may do whatever they believe <em>necessary</em> to succeed in creating this “better world”.</p>
            <p>The most notable examples of this are: Nazi Germany, Ku Klux Klan, Fascist Italy, Marxist/Leninist/Stalinist Russia and modern North Korea. The pattern here is that they all have an ideal world in mind and do what ever is necessary to accomplish this utopia. The problem lies in the what ever is necessary. While pursuing their personal slice of heaven on Earth, they are in fact creating a hell on Earth for everyone else. Just look at the wake left behind by all of these pursuits - violence, war, mass death and suffering, famine, economic crisis. They all successfully created a dystopia.</p>
            <p>The fourth and final is heaven within us. Heaven doesn’t have to be a place, it can be a state of mind. If you live your life rich with meaning, happiness and gratitude for the fact that anything exists at all - let alone a self that can interpret all of this information you will begin to realize that heaven is always the here and now. If you live each day with purpose driven goals - whether it be physical well being and fitness, learning new things and mental stimulation, creative outlets, working towards a better community or society and caring for those who cannot care for themselves. All of these are goal oriented and living them each day will endow your life with meaning, that combined with the love and companionship found within a circle of friends and family can create a personal heaven within yourself. There is no need to wait for an afterlife to experience heaven, it’s already here and within reach of anybody as long as they know what to look for.</p>
