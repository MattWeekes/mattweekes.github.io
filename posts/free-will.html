            <p>Do we have the free will to make choices or are we just puppets to a deterministic universe? This book discusses the philosophical dilemma from the point that free will is in fact an illusion.</p>
            <p>We do not have the freedom that we intuitively feel that we have. We can make conscious decisions, but everything that makes up those decisions is determined by factors outside of your control. Say that you decided to have coffee instead of tea with breakfast this morning, you would have chosen coffee because that is what you wanted at that moment. But you didn’t choose to want coffee, that’s just what you wanted. Let’s rewind time back to breakfast before you made your decision, could you have chosen or could you have wanted otherwise?</p>
            <p>This raises moral questions. Can you blame a psychopath for harming other people if they couldn’t have done otherwise? You don’t <em>choose</em> to be a psychopath, that happens from factors outside of your control. If a man attacks someone on the street then there is something wrong with his frame of mind to want to do that. If you were to trade places with this man, atom for atom; your body, your brain and your sense of self would be him. You would have his memories, emotions and desires and would act in the same manner.</p>
            <p>What if you could cure psychopathy? Let’s take the hypothetical man above, he has physically harmed and emotionally manipulated people for most of his life from desires beyond his control - it could be genetics, a brain condition, an accident, bad parents or life experiences. We’ll say he has a brain tumor in the specific location of the brain that would explain his impulses. We remove the tumor and cure him completely, he feels empathy and no longer has these desires to harm and manipulate. Would he still need to be punished for his previous crimes? After all now he is a completely different person, just as you would be a completely different person if you underwent an extremely profound experience such as a near death experience or just as you are a completely different person to who you were 10 years ago.</p>
            <p class="quote">"The urge for retribution depends on our not seeing the underlying causes of human behaviour."</p>
            <p>If you sit down and pay close attention to your own thoughts, you will notice that they just appear and you can hardly decide what the next thought will be. You are not the author of your own thoughts as that would require you to think of the thought before you think of it. You don’t choose your thoughts, or the emotions you often feel. You don’t choose your parents, your place of birth, your gender and even most of your life experiences aren’t by your choosing. You didn’t have any choice in your genetics and how your brain has developed and now your brain is making choices based on preferences from your life experiences, physical and mental development and interactions with other people, activities and ideas. Sure, you’re free to do what you want now - but where did these desires comes from? How free can you be if everything that you consciously decide comes from events in the brain that you didn’t choose and which you are entirely unaware of?</p>
            <p>There is a very interesting study on free will with a fMRI machine. Subjects were asked to decide and press one of two buttons, one under each hand. On a screen in front of them a random letter was displayed and would change at half second intervals. The subject was to report which letter was displayed when they <em>decided</em> to press a button. While watching the brain activity, the regions involved in decision making became active up to 10 seconds before the subject consciously decided and also that the motor cortexes became active five seconds before deciding the press the button. This suggests that your brain decided what you were going to do before “you” decided.</p>
            <p class="quote">"some moments before you are aware of what you will do next - a time in which you subjectively appear to have complete freedom to behave however you please - <em>your brain has already determined what you will do</em>."</p>
            <p>The topic of free will is a deeply interesting one and is far better explained and articulated in this book, which is short and easy to digest and follow.</p>
