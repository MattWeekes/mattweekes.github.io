        <div class="post-content">
            <p>The search for spiritual enlightenment, universal understanding and inner peace is one many people seek. In this book the protagonist - Siddhartha leaves his life of palace living on such a quest. He leaves with his friend - Govinda to learn directly from a man who has attained enlightenment himself, commonly known as the Buddha but in this story he is also known as Gotama.</p>
            <p>Siddhartha and Govinda represent two methods of trying to attain such spiritual goals. Govinda finds it necessary to learn from a master, and so has always followed a teacher and the path of “religion”. When he meets Gotama he decides to devote himself entirely to learning from the man which has attained enlightenment. Siddhartha takes the opposite path, he believes enlightenment comes from within and cannot be taught. When he meets Gotama he realizes that Gotama’s teachings can’t guarantee that one will attain his spiritual goals and that he needs to take his own path. After all, Gotama had no teacher!</p>
            <p class="quote">"There is one thing that this clear, worthy instruction does not contain; it does not contain the secret of what the Illustrious One himself experienced - he alone among hundreds of thousands. That is what I thought and realized when I heard your teachings. That is why I am going my own way - not to seek another doctrine, for I know there is none, but to leave all doctrines and all teachers and to reach my goal alone - or die.” - Siddhartha</p>
            <p>Siddhartha takes a path of indulgence and material wealth. He meets a woman who promises to teach him to love if he first gets nice clothing and wealth, so he becomes the apprentice of a wealthy merchant, to learn how to be wealthy. He spends many years accumulating wealth and possessions, learning to love, and over indulging in food, wine and gambling. After following this path for many years he realizes no spiritual growth or wisdom will come out of it and leaves to seek a new path. He wanders to a nearby river, and full of despair plunges into the river in an attempt at suicide. As he sinks in the river, a very powerful “OM” penetrates his consciousness, awakening him to the foolishness of his suicide. This represents the death of the old Siddhartha and the rebirth of a new Siddhartha - his new path begins here.</p>
            <p>He awakens near a hut by the river in which resides a very simple man - a ferryman who lives by the river and ferries people over on his raft. This ferryman is very content and at peace, Siddhartha discovers that the ferryman never actively sought spiritual development - he simply listened to the river, which taught him how to be. When Siddhartha contemplates the river it metaphorically speaks to him too. He learns how to listen - how to take in experiences with an open soul, without passion, without desire, without judgement. Attaching these things to experiences all lead to suffering - if you experience something as just pure experience there will be only peace. He also learns that gentleness and love are far stronger than severity - for the water of the river is stronger than the rock, the water wears down the rock. The big realization, though I prefer to think of it as the “mouse that sunk the ship”, is that the self and time is an illusion - The river is always there and always flowing, yet always new. The water flows to the waterfall, to the ocean, evaporates and rains back down in one big cycle. The river appears to always be the same river, but in fact is never made up of the same parts and is eternally changing. Just as the rocks get broken down into their elements and become something else, whether it be dirt, plants, animals or even a Buddha. The universe is in an eternal cycle.</p>
            <p>Govinda and Siddhartha are reunited as old men. Upon hearing a rumour that a wise man lives in the ferry hut, Govinda seeks to speak with this man. Upon meeting again Govinda sees Siddhartha as enlightened, and asks him to teach him the secret as Govinda is still suffering. Siddhartha, upon seeing Govinda’s fault in needing an external explanation which led to his failure - you can’t teach enlightenment, just smiles and whispers that Govinda should bow and gently kiss his forehead. Govinda, though confused at such a strange request, does this and upon doing so has a vision of faces in the river and achieves enlightenment himself.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else … Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.”</p>
            <p>So what does this story mean to those of us that do seek peace within? It means that following a doctrine will not deliver the results. A doctrine can be a useful guide, to keep you on the right path away from all the fools gold - material possessions, wealth, relationships and any other external sources people constantly chase for meaning. But the inner peace and liberation from human suffering that we all seek can only be attained on our own path, through our own personal experiences and realizations. Just as telling someone to “always look on the bright side” doesn’t make them into an optimistic person - they only hear hollow meaningless words. However if they have a major life experience in which they feel that deep within their core, as Siddhartha did in the river, it changes how they perceive the world entirely. Suddenly a foolish platitude such as “love is always the answer” becomes a mantra, a universal and undeniable truth.</p>
            <p>We communicate through words, but words don’t give any justice to what we actually experience. Especially when it comes to experiences of transcendence or enlightenment. Have you ever tried to tell a funny anecdote only to have no one really get it and all you could say was “you had to be there” - no words that exist carry the weight of what you experienced, you will never be able to truly translate what you felt.</p>
