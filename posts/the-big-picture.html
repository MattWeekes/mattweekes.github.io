        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Since humans began thinking, we’ve been wondering about the meaning of it all and our place in the universe. That everything happens for a reason was widely believed to be true in the past, but as we discover more about how the universe works we see less reasons to believe that this is true. As civilization advances we gain a better understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and the hows and whys of everything happening.</p>
            <p>We are made of a large arrangement of atoms, but we don’t feel like this on the macroscopic level. Let’s take the analogy of the Ship of Theseus, which retired to a harbour to be a museum piece. Over the years the ship began to rot and wear and parts had to be replaced, after a century every plank that made Theseus’ original ship had been replaced with new ones - one by one. At which point is the ship no longer the original ship? The easiest way to think about this is that it still is the Ship of Theseus, even after replacing every physical part, its identity isn’t made by its physical arrangement but by a convention we created. Just as when you see a picture of yourself as a baby you identify with the baby even though every atom that made up that baby is different to every atom that makes up the current you. It isn’t convenient to talk about things as their atomic arrangements and while the deepest level of reality is very important, so are the other levels of reality.</p>
            <p>To understand the hows and whys of reality we need to understand them at the most microscopic level all the way up to the absolute macroscopic level. Through science we have a good understanding of how things work and interact, we’ve even traced the universe back in time almost 14 billion years to the Big Bang. But that’s where our understanding of physics breaks down and we don’t know what happened any earlier. At that moment the universe was in a very orderly state (low entropy) and over the last 14 billion years has progressively become more disorderly (high entropy). Due to the second law of thermodynamics (the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time) we have the arrow of time, which is why we remember the past but not the future, why eggs can break but not unbreak, why you can’t unmix milk and coffee and why we age and die.</p>
            <p>On the macroscopic level we have things that can’t necessarily be fully explained from the microscopic level (at least not yet for the most part). A basic example to start off with would be a table. On its most fundamental level a table is just an arrangement of atoms, there is nothing among it’s atomic arrangement that gives it its “tableness”. There is no doubt the table is real on the macroscopic level, this is an <em>emergent property</em>. Now we shift up a gear to an emergent property everyone has experienced - <em>consciousness</em>. Consciousness is undoubtedly a real thing, Rene Descartes said consciousness is the one undeniable fact of our existence.</p>
            <p class="quote">“I Think, Therefore I am” -Rene Descartes</p>
            <p>Yet if we look within the brain at different microscopic levels there is no physical properties of consciousness, there is only a collection of neurons, synapses, electrical signals and chemical reactions. At this level humans seem to be automatons, whose actions are simply reactions to the environment based on predetermined physical states of the universe. Yet at the macroscopic level, it feels as though we have the ability to make decisions, think thoughts and create our own futures with the power of self direction.</p>
            <p>Another popular Cartesian concept is the body and soul (or mind) duality. It was in Descartes work <em>“Meditations on First Philosophy”</em> that he argued the idea that the mind was independent of the body and that it was the mind/soul that separated conscious beings from those that aren’t. Descartes stated that the body was a machine, obeying the physical laws however the mind was not made of material stuff and did not exist within the material plane. He believed that the immaterial mind could push around the material body and that the body still affected the mind (you stub your toe, your mind still feels the pain), that the mind was housed within the pineal gland - a small gland within the brain of vertebrates, the reason for believing this was that the pineal gland seemed to be the only part of the brain that was not bicameral and we could only experience one thought at a time.</p>
            <p>If Descartes was putting forward this theory today, it would be exceedingly difficult to gain credibility with our understanding of the laws of physics. To imagine that a soul pushes around the atoms in our bodies in a way that we haven’t detected is conceivable, but it implies that modern physics is profoundly incorrect in ways that have eluded every controlled experiment ever conducted.</p>
            <p>The implications of our understanding run far deeper than stating that the mind/soul is a process rather than an immaterial object or substance, most notably that there is no life after death. If all that makes up a living being are the observable particles and forces of the Core Theory of physics, then the information that makes up “you” is contained within your body. There is no place for that information to go or for it to be preserved outside of your body, there aren’t any particles or fields that can carry it away. This might appear strange at first but that’s because people usually think of life as a substance, but it’s better to think of life as a <em>process</em>.</p>
            <p class="quote">”When a candle is burning there is a flame that clearly carries energy, when that flame is extinguished that energy doesn’t go anywhere. The candle still contains energy in it’s atoms and molecules. What happens instead is that the process of combustion has ceased. Life is like that: it’s not “stuff”; it’s a set of things happening. When that process stops, life stops. Life is a way of talking about a particular sequence of events taking place among atoms and molecules arranged in the right way”.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest <strong>unanswered</strong> questions we have is how did life start? How can a bunch of non-living stuff spark a living cell? This brings us back to thinking of life as a <em>process</em>. In abiotic (non-living) material, everything follows the second law of thermodynamics by trying to release energy to create a higher entropy. This seems to imply that in an abiotic environment there was energy trapped and life was a solution to releasing that energy. The current most widely accepted theory is that the early Earth atmosphere was rich with a particular chemical makeup - consisting largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, phosphorus, methane, ammonia and water. This mixture combined with electricity (from a lightning rich early Earth) can spark amino acids which is a building block for all life on Earth. The debates about the origins of life come in the next part, how the amino acids went from a precursor into a living cell that could reproduce and pass on information.</p>
            <p>While we don’t have conclusive proof to all of the steps involved there are many hypotheses around this. A favoured one being life coming from near underwater thermal vents. Once a protocell (RNA encapsulated inside a membrane) is created in a pond near a vent, the current pushes the protocell around from hot to cold water. At the cold end, the RNA grows by gathering nuecleotides from its surroundings and two RNA strands huddle together. Then it drifts back to the hot side and the RNA strands are peeled apart which creates fatty acid molecules until it divides. Some of the times that this happens will result in two protocells with identical RNA, which drift back to the cold side and the process repeats - thus reproduction is born.</p>
            <p>Almost 400 million years ago a little fish crawled out of the sea to live its life as a land creature, thus starting the evolutionary chain of land dwelling animals. This little fish is known as <em>Tiktaalik rosae</em>. We don’t know what these new creatures would be thinking about, but we can speculate that as they adapted to their new world they began to develop simple levels of consciousness that would grow into what we know and see today. The big new adaption would be how they think about their environment. In the sea, vision is limited due to how far light can travel underwater - you’d be lucky to see tens of meters ahead. Fish need to think and react very quickly to their ever changing environment, at any moment new creatures appear into view that might be prey or predator and to survive they need to be constantly ready. However on land, vision is seemingly infinite - you can see all the way to the horizon where the Earth curves below itself. Land animals can see prey or predators in advance and have time to contemplate what to do about a situation before acting, developing a deeper level of thinking.</p>
            <p>Developing this advanced method of thought, needing to weigh up options and choose the best action rather than instantly reacting to everything as it comes into view, would eventually grow into <em>self awareness</em>. Consciousness is a strange thing, on one level it feels as though you are a viewer residing behind the eyes and controlling the body. This of course is not the case. There are a few processes behind the veil of consciousness that bring it to the surface, one of which is the unconscious thought - the kind of mental processes that could naturally come from evolutionary biology before consciousness itself emerged being one. The second - while there is no dictator in the mind there does seem to be a seat of cognition where the input from all the modes get sewn together to create a continuum of experience.</p>
            <p>In Psychology there is a popular way of thinking about this, divided into “<em>System 1 </em>” and “<em>System 2 </em>”. System 1 is what runs all the processes beyond our conscious awareness, it is automatic “fast” thinking driven by unconscious reactions. When you make a coffee or drive home from work without consciously paying attention to every little action you need to take to fulfill these tasks, this is System 1 running the show. System 2 is our conscious and rational thinking, it demands full focus to work out. When you’re trying to solve a mathematical problem, learn a new skill or any other complex task is when System 2 is at play. As we go through our daily life System 1 is the system mostly in charge even though we give most of our credit to self aware System 2. Think of it like a man riding an elephant - System 1 is the elephant and System 2 is the man. The man exerts some control over the elephant but ultimately the elephant is calling the shots and doing all the work, but the man gladly takes credit for everything.</p>
            <p>The “now” of your perception isn’t the same as the current moment in time. Even though it feels like now is in real-time and you are making decisions and reacting in real-time, it takes time for the brain to stitch all these processes together. If you use one hand to touch your nose and the other to touch your toes at the same time it <em>feels</em> like they happen simultaneously but it takes more time for the signal from your toes to reach the brain than it does from the nose. What happens is that your brain waits for all the relevant inputs before presenting the information to your conscious perceptions. So what typically happens is the “now” you experience is actually a few hundred milliseconds older.</p>
            <p>What does all this have to say about free will? If we’re just a bunch of atoms bumping together in the direction of time are we really calling the shots or just watching the predetermined show unfold? When you get dressed in the morning and you are trying to decide what colour shirt to wear it seems like you’re making a choice, you don’t decide by thinking “I’ll just wear whatever the atoms that make up me are going to deterministically do” because you don’t know what that is - it isn’t a relevant way of thinking in that scenario. An interesting experiment performed by Benjamin Libet scanned the brains of subjects while they decided to raise one hand. As the subject decided they also took note of the exact time on a clock that they made the decision. The results showed that the brain had actually made the decision seconds before the subject <em>consciously</em> decided.</p>
            <p>This has interesting implications on blame and responsibility. A man in Texas had surgery to help alleviate symptoms of epilepsy, but post surgery developed a brain tumor. This tumor led to the development of hyper-sexuality and the patient began downloading child-pornography, which led to a prison sentence. He didn’t choose to have a brain tumor, he didn’t choose to have these thoughts. If instead they removed the tumor and the hyper-sexuality disappeared, and as a result he longer had those thoughts and was appalled by his actions and behaviour - would punishment still be a better action? Charles Whitman (aka the Texas Tower Shooter) went on a killing spree where he shot random people from a university tower. The autopsy showed a brain tumor that exhibited necrosis which could have affected his amygdala. This could have affected his behaviour, changing who he is <em>entirely</em>. We don’t get to choose our thoughts or desires, they just happen to us. We’re victims of circumstance.</p>
            <p>As we dig deep into the fundamentals of reality we see no sign of a grand purpose to our lives. Ideas such as “meaning”, “purpose” and “morality” aren’t found in the Core Theory of physics, but neither are tables and bathtubs. That doesn’t mean that they aren’t real, they play a vital role as an emergent idea on the macroscopic scale that we live in even though they aren’t built into the architecture of the universe. This means that it’s up to us create our own personal purpose, which can be a scary and exhausting prospect. We get to decide what to devote our lives towards. When faced with this realization, some people embrace the freedom - feeling a great weight lift off their shoulders when there is no objective right or wrong way to live your life. Others fall into a well of nihilism - feeling lost and crippled at the fact that there isn’t a correct path to take, they begin to think that nothing matters. This is an unhealthy perspective to cling to, just because there isn’t a higher power to hand your life direction to you on a silver platter doesn’t mean that nothing matters. <em>You</em> get to decide what does and does not matter.</p>
            <p class="quote">”The world, and what happens in the world, matters. Why? Because it matters to me. And it matters to you.”</p>
            <p>Sean Carroll dived far deeper into these topics, but to avoid writing a book about this book I’ve just brushed on the main concepts. It’s a good read for any fan of both philosophy and physics.</p>
