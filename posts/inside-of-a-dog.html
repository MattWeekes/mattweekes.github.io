            <p>Inside of a Dog takes a look at the minds of our beloved pets to try and understand their subjective experience. The author, Alexandra Horowitz, is not only a dog lover but a neuroscientist and psychologist - so tackling the questions of what one experiences subjectively is what she’s good at. To understand what dogs might be experiencing and how they think, we need to understand their behaviour and how they perceive the world through their senses.</p>
            <p>First addressed is dog licks - their sense of taste. Dogs have well refined taste buds, which could be an adaptive trait from their omnivorous diets to be able to determine what is good or what is toxic and what is ripe or unripe. Taste and smell are a dogs primary method of exploring the world, which is why it’s common to see a dog chewing on what we would think of as gross objects (feces, dirt, rocks, worms etc). When you arrive home and your dog greets you with licks to the face what is he saying? Owners will often refer to this as a dog kissing you - however this is anthropomorphizing the dogs behaviour, and doing so is misleading to understanding any animal. If we look to wild dogs or their ancestors, wolves, we see that younger dogs will lick the muzzle of the mother when she returns from a hunt to elicit a regurgitation response to feed the young. How disappointed our pets must be when we never regurgitate our last meal for them… Furthermore our mouths are full of flavours to a dogs sensitive taste buds, a variety of tastes of all the foods and drinks we’ve consumed since our last brush is a party to a dog. But licks aren’t always this gross, a lick can compliment the sense of smell to gather information of where you’ve been and what you’ve been doing since you left. Dogs also groom each other with licks or lick at the face of a larger, threatening dog to appease him. </p>
            <p>A dogs sense of smell is it’s primary method of exploring the world. Where we would examine something with our eyes for understanding, a dog needs a good sniff. Their sense of smell is millions of times better than ours, a dog can detect the scent of sugar if a teaspoon of sugar was diluted in an Olympic sized swimming pool. A dog can read us very well by our smell, the concoction of chemicals we constantly extrude through our sweat glands say a lot about what we’re feeling. Fear, excitement, anger, illness, our hormonal balance and pheromones are all pieces of information a dog can gather just by being near us. Dog breeds with the more powerful noses (such as Bloodhounds) can detect the trail of a person days after they’ve been there. The skin cells, hairs and various chemicals let off in our sweat can work as a neon lit pathway of where we’ve been. Even some diseases or conditions set off distinct smells and researchers have begun training dogs to detect specific smells set off by cancerous or unhealthy tissues. The dogs were rewarded by responding to smells collected by cancer patients in either urine or breath samples - when put in practise the results were strong even though the testing size was quite small. In one study the dogs only missed 14 out of 1,272 attempts to detect ill patients! Dogs have shown promising results in sniffing out early stages of melanoma and cancers of the skin, breast, bladder and lungs. They’ve even shown to be promising at predicting a seizure in children with epilepsy by acting more protective over the child before the episode strikes.</p>
            <p>Anyone that has walked a dog, especially a male dog, will be familiar with them having to mark almost every tree or post they walk by. These spots are like a public noticeboard to the dog, where all the other animals go to leave a message and he’s just leaving his own message. The urine scent he leaves behind contains a lot of information about himself as well as how often he visits this spot and when he was there last (Max was here ‘19). In a similar way it’s true for butt sniffing, there’s a gland around a dogs butt that emits an odour that carries so much information about that dog - their diet and lifestyle, it’s like having a conversation. Washing your dog also affects how he’ll be perceived socially. While that artificial strawberry scent may be nice to your nose, it confuses the dog. His smell is his identity, and this is why a bathed dog immediately runs off to rub himself on his bed, toys or the grass - he’s trying to rub his smell back on himself.</p>
            <p>A dogs sense of sight is just a complimentary sense. As humans we gain most of the information about the world through sight but for dogs this is only an auxiliary sense. Our eyes differ in two important ways; first is by colour. We see seven distinct colours across the spectrum of light waves in many hues and saturation’s (as noticed in a rainbow), from the intense high frequency violet to the low frequency reds. However dogs don’t get quite the vibrant display when they see different wavelengths of light, their vision covers a faded blue in the high frequency end and a faded yellow in the lows with dull grey encapsulating those. Take a rainbow for example, one half we would see - violet, indigo, blue and a tealish colour. A dog would see that as - grey, greyish blue, dull blue and greyish white. The second half we would see - green, yellow, orange, red. A dog would see - dull yellow, slightly less faded yellow, almost yellow and grey. Though where dogs lack colour perception they make up for it by having night vision properties. Behind the eye of a dog there is a reflector that sends the light coming in back onto the eye to gather that information a second time, the result being that what they see is twice as bright. You can see this in action if you’ve ever tried to photograph a dog with a camera flash or shined a light in their eyes and seen that creepy green tinge reflecting back at you (this works on any night vision animals such as cats and crocodiles). Dogs also have faster vision than humans, what I mean by that is their vision has evolved to track fast running prey. A good analogy would be to explain it with FPS (frames per second) - dogs have higher FPS. When we watch TV we don’t perceive it as a series of still images being shown in rapid succession, we see a smoothly transitioning “video”. Dogs however do see gaps between the frames due to their faster vision, their eyes take in information at a quicker rate. This is why dogs are great at chasing balls, because they see more per second than we do so they can follow its trajectory much better. While a cricket or baseball fielder can follow and catch a rapidly travelling ball quite well, if their eyes took in information as quickly as a dogs they could see where the ball actually is slightly quicker.</p>
            <p>Dogs communicate through body language - his posture, head position, tail and eyes are all positioned meaningfully to express what he is feeling. If you learn to read a dogs body language you can understand what he’s “saying”. This is very noticeable in play, if a Chihuahua were to meet a Wolfhound and square up to each other you might be inclined to think the Chihuahua thinks himself a big dog too - this is wrong. Chihuahuas know they are much smaller than Wolfhounds, but they also know the Wolfhound doesn’t intend to eat him based on his body language. The play signal is seen in a dogs “bow”, when a dog bows with the front of his body leaving his rump and tail high in the air he is saying “let’s play”. Both dogs know their size differences and the Wolfhound will hold back to not hurt the little Chihuahua and spend much of the play time laying down and exposing his belly to level the playing field to make the game more fair. </p>
            <p>It isn’t just as straight forward as looking at a dogs tail to tell his emotions, you need to pay attention to every detail and even recognize patterns in behaviour. Dogs are like poker players, they have many “tells” and if you learn what to look for you can see their hand all too often. If you can understand a dog, you’ll know when he’s bored and wants attention and can occupy him before he starts misbehaving to get that attention, you’ll know when he gets anxious and be able to comfort him before he starts nervously nipping and whining, you’ll know when he wants to go outside, come inside or lay on your lap. It’s much easier to address the needs of a dog than it is to command him to behave appropriately when he’s troubled, all too often you see owners scold a dog for misbehaving but if they stopped and pondered for a moment; “why is my dog misbehaving, what needs aren’t being met” the solution to the problem could be all too simple.</p>
            <p>So what is it like to be a dog? Presumably it is like something to be a dog, they’re conscious, sentient and likely self aware creatures. In 1974 Thomas Nagel put forward an interesting paper / thought experiment that philosophers have been discussing since - “What Is It Like To Be A Bat?”. Again, presumably it is like something to be a bat. Nagel’s point is that we can never truly know, unless we could experience exactly what a bat experiences we’re simply inferring using a theory of mind. The same is true for dogs and even for me to ask what is it like to be you. The best I can do is infer based on the information I’ve gathered from observing you. This is also the best we can do to try and understand what a dog experiences and the more accurate question to speculate on would be; “what is it like to be <em>this</em> dog”? After all, each dog has a different personality.</p>
            <p>We can see that dogs experience emotions; joy, excitement, fear, anxiety. They have a subjective perception of time; the fear and resistance when they realize they’re going to the vet - they remember this route leads to the trauma of a vet visit, and the burying of bones for future retrieval. They can solve basic problems; pressing buttons and pulling ropes to gain access to food. Dogs think, feel, learn and understand their environments and have complex social behaviour. How much free will can a dog exercise? For example some of us can resist temptations by reasoning out the consequences (not eating that delicious cake to stick with a diet, not drinking alcohol all day to perform well with our other daily tasks). We can train a dog to resist temptations but that’s not really exercising their free will, rather it’s obeying orders.</p>
            <p>If we want to take a seat in the mind of a dog we need to empathize deeply with them. By understanding how they perceive the world, the hows and whys of their behaviour and how they address and solve their problems we can project ourselves into their shoes (paws) and imagine what they’re thinking and feeling. This may not be a perfect understanding of what a dog is truly experiencing, but it’s the closest we can get. Next time you’re walking your dog and he won’t stop sniffing that tree trunk, don’t tug the lead to hurry him along. Try and project yourself into the seat of his mind and experience what he may be experiencing, the smells of that tree trunk could be to him what a beautiful sunset is to you. How rude it would be if someone was shoving you along forcing you to miss out on such a beautiful moment in life.</p>
