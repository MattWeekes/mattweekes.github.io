        <div class="post-content">
            <p>This book looks at the modern era and compares it to two of the most popular dystopian novels; Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (published in 1932) and 1984 by George Orwell (published in 1949). Amusing Ourselves To Death was published in 1985 so it’s not entirely accurate with the modern era anymore, so I’ll be speculating on how it applies to our era right now using the core ideas conveyed in this book. For those who have not read both of the mentioned novels I’ll briefly outline their core concepts so you can still follow this post (I’ll avoid spoilers so that you can still choose to read those books!)</p>
            <p><strong>1984</strong> is set in a dystopian future (well 1984 was the future in 1949) where the government controls the populous through forceful oppression. Everyone is spied on at every moment, their thoughts and conversations monitored to prevent rebellion, everything is handed out in rations and there is no freedom.</p>
            <p><strong>Brave New World</strong> is also set in a dystopian future but the government controls the populous in a more subtle manner. Embreyos are treated in certain manners to raise adults to fit society - if they need more lower class factory workers they’ll treat embreyos in a particular manner so the resulting adult is simple minded and they enjoy their role in society, if they need more upper class scientists they’ll raise the embreyo to be intelligent, if they need more people in the tropics the embreyo will be raised to enjoy warm weather, or to enjoy cold weather if they need more people in the Arctic etc. When ever they aren’t working they are mindlessly entertained by novel activities, the most notable being a fictional happy pill named “Soma”. Soma is rationed out and taken daily to make the user happy, preventing philosophical thought and spiritual development as it’s considered absurd and unnecessary. They are still being completely controlled but they are essentially doing so voluntarily.</p>
            <p>It’s obvious which of these is most applicable to our era, Amusing Ourselves To Death jumps right into pointing at the Huxley dystopia (Brave New World) by comparing television with Soma. The main issue brought up is not that television provides shallow amusement (because that’s optional today) but that everything that is broadcast is presented as amusing. News, religion and politics are the main arguments brought forward. </p>
            <p>News programs are the prime example - they’re supposed to be the daily news and give us an insight into what is new in the world. The average length of a news story is only 45 seconds, that’s less than a minute to convey the context of an entire story. The reason for this is to keep viewers watching. News programs measure their success the same way as any TV program, that is by how many viewers it has - not by how informative or accurate the content is. The average length of a “shot” on TV is 3.5 seconds, this is to ensure our eyes always have something new to look at to prevent boredom, a lack of interest and changing the channel. By tailoring news stories to compete with the game of showbiz, the actual information that is meant to be conveyed becomes decontextualized. The result - disinformation. The story still informs the viewers, but the information is an illusion. It creates the illusion of knowing something by delivering the shell of the information without touching the underlying causes and core of what is happening. We all know someone that can sound smart by dropping a bunch of buzzwords but when probed on the topics you discover they don’t actually know what they’re talking about - that’s what’s happening.</p>
            <p>Rarely will we learn something useful from the daily news, we get a decontextualized shell of a story. How many of us actually know about the core reasons behind the conflicts in North Korea, the Middle East or Russia or why there are so many refugees and how they’re being treated? For those of you shouting “Yes, me! I am very informed.” I’m willing to bet you didn’t get that information from the 6 o’clock News.</p>
            <p>Politics is also hollowed out by how it is portrayed on television. The comparison Postman makes is to Abe Lincoln - in which the political debates would last about 6 hours where the two candidates would get a couple of hours each to express their ideas and then another hour or so each at the end to counter their opponent. An actual in depth analysis and discussion of a politicians ideas aren’t easy to find now, the easiest available information is broadcast as television commercials - small less than 30 second snippets. Even in this you’ll have noticed often that rather than spend this iota of screen time expressing how they’d improve the country, they spend it bashing their opponents view and trying to tarnish their reputation. For a prime example of politics as entertainment we only need to look at the current president of the United States - a former reality TV star whose air time as a leader is still entirely flippant.</p>
            <p>What Neil Postman couldn’t express with a book published in 1985 is the modern internet, particularly with social media. It’s safe to assume that almost everyone has a little computer with internet access in their possession at all times, it’s absurd to find someone without a smart phone. This in combination with social media is what creates our Soma. Being able to share our ideas and snippets of our lives with others so easily is good, but it often goes too far. When you’re given the statistical number of people paying attention to you, your brain gives off a little hit of dopamine (or perhaps just disappointment) which becomes addictive. These little hits of pleasurable neurochemistry is what Soma is. It’s too easy to immerse yourself in the game of who gets the most likes or compare your lives to others through social media, but just as the news is often a shell of the facts - a persons social media content is only a shell of their own lives. For the most part, people share their better moments on social media and keep their darkest days private and to compare your own life to how someone appears to be living through social media is often going to leave you down on yourself.</p>
            <p>This has been a bit of a bitter pill to read, write and think about so I’ll conclude on a more positive note. This isn’t inherently bad and to see through the illusion, the game of it all is the first step to liberating yourself. There is no nefarious group trying to keep us all subdued and in the dark as is the case in Brave New World (although to find out that the Federal Police recently raided the ABC to destroy evidence and arrest journalists makes you wonder). The creators of these mediums are just playing their own game of who can get the most viewers - more viewers equals more money after all. So where do we go from here? I’m not saying you shouldn’t watch the news every night, if that’s what you enjoy - although for me an hour of death, violence, famine and manipulation is enough for a few months of sleepless nights. Just be aware of the biases involved, take it with a pinch of salt, and if a story intrigues you do some research and learn what’s really going on. </p>
            <p>As for social media, that’s a dangerous game. While it’s a very useful tool, it’s easy to get caught up in the game without realizing you’re even playing. Those dopamine hits you constantly get from checking your notifications are the same hits that drug users get. If someone takes some pills for a few days after surgery they’re considered users - they’re using the tool to help them. But if they were to take pills too often and for recreational reasons they’d be perceived as a junkie - they’re abusing the tool. There are far too many social media junkies out there. If you’ve got a social media app shortcut on the home page of your phone and need to check it every few hours, well I’ve got news for you.</p>
            <p>The good news is that there are still plenty of sane people out there, and anyone can join their ranks. The type of person that can sit in an empty room, alone in silence and not need some form of external amusement or validation is a good sign of this. You’d be amazed at how quickly some people reach for their phone when they’re alone with their thoughts for a moment. Rather than spending hours mindlessly scrolling through a news feed, spend that time in a way that will improve you as a person.</p>
