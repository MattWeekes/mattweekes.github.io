        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Have you ever heard of, or maybe even experienced the phenomenon of Sleep Paralysis?</p>
            <p>Sleep Paralysis is a state of consciousness between being awake and asleep. The mind is aware but the body is still paralyzed ( your body is paralyzed in certain parts of the sleep cycle to protect you from acting out your dreams and harming yourself ) and you experience hallucinations from the hypnagogic dream state. In this state you can hear voices and noises, feel and see beings, and often have them interact with you. For the most part this is a terrifying experience.</p>
            <p>As someone who occasionally experiences this, the knowledge gained from the book is incredibly useful. It goes into all aspects, from scientific research to spirituality to mythology. This sheds light on how and why it is happening, how to prevent it (or induce it), the universally common experiences and visions and the cultural stories behind the phenomenon.</p>
            <p>The synchronicities are particularly interesting, how my experiences can be so similar to people from all over the world. Many report feeling a presence watching them from the shadows, and is almost always perceived as malevolent. They see a dark figure, hag or demon which can even be on the bed with them or mounted on their chest, even strangling them.</p>
            <p>It’s stuff like this that makes people afraid to go back to sleep!</p>
            <p>The good news is that this can’t physically harm you, which made it easy for me to accept ( and even embrace ). In fact, in the book it is explained how to use this to enter a lucid dream and that is where the human mind gets really amazing.</p>
            <p>Dreaming and Sleep Paralysis has created inspiration in many famous works of art. Artists such as Salvador Dali, Max Ernst and Zdzislaw Beksinski painted their visions, while Authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickins and Bram Stoker wrote it into their stories.</p>
            <p>I find the dream states incredibly interesting and a Sleep Paralysis episode is as real as it gets. Most of the time a dream feels real while it’s being experienced but after you’ve woken up it seems so obvious. Sleep Paralysis still felt real after waking and still feels real in my memory, it’s no doubt how someone could think this was truly an evil spirit, ghost, demon, vampire or <strong>*insert scary creature here*</strong> attacking them. There’s even reports of alien encounters and abduction experiences in this altered state, and offers a logical explanation to some of the ‘I was abducted from my bed by aliens’ stories.</p>
            <p>I’m sure some of you are waiting for me to share my experiences, so I’ll add the four of mine that happened in succession over a few months but also come as a continuing linked series.</p>
            <p><u><strong>First</strong></u></p>
            <p>I stirred awake only to find my body wouldn’t respond to my movements when I tried to shift sleeping positions. I knew what Sleep Paralysis was but I didn’t know anything about it at this stage so I didn’t panic. It felt like something was watching me from the foot of my bed but I couldn’t move to get it into view. After what felt like a minute of confusion and discomfort I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.</p>
            <p><u><strong>Second</strong></u></p>
            <p>I woke up feeling incredibly uncomfortable and worried, I was travelling in my van at this time and camping by a small river under a railway road in Queensland. My whole body felt slightly heavier than usual and I couldn’t move any part, there was something very evil in the drivers seat behind the curtain. I needed to move and do something but it was impossible. The doors were all locked so the only way in was to smash through a window, and as an incredibly light sleeper that didn’t happen. So whatever this evil <em>thing</em> is, it isn’t of the physical realm. I tried to just yell and scream, to wake some campers and maybe they’ll come help somehow but again it was impossible to make a sound. I couldn’t move or make noise and something very evil was sitting behind a curtain directly behind my head and it was here for <em>me</em>. This was probably the most fear I had felt in my life to this point.</p>
            <p>I remember being in an awful, panicky state for a few minutes then must have fallen asleep.</p>
            <p>This is when I decided to research Sleep Paralysis properly.</p>
            <p><u><strong>Third</strong></u></p>
            <p>Sleeping at home this time when I woke up, my door was open a crack which is very unusual. I wanted to get up and close it but I couldn’t move at all, my body felt a little heavy. My eyes flicked to the mirror in the other corner where I could see into the open door, but that wasn’t all I could see. I could also see a dark robed figure, a silhouette of average height. A dark hand gripped the open door and opened it a fraction further. Fortunately by now I had done a good amount of research and new what was happening and that I wasn’t in real danger. I still watched, scared that this thing might enter the room but it slipped away without closing my door.<br /> <em>It's irritating when people (or beings) don't close my door!</em></p>
            <p><u><strong>Fourth</strong></u></p>
            <p>I stirred a little, waking up from a dream that I don’t remember. I felt a cat sleeping on my chest so I decided not to move and disturb it, until I remembered I don’t have a cat. I tried to move and see what was on me but couldn’t, my eyes shifted to see what it was from my peripheral vision. I could see a small gargoyle-looking black demon about the size of large house cat, with pure white eyes. It saw that I saw it and pressed down harder on my chest and began snarling like a ravenous dog. I could feel it’s warm breath in waves over my face and it’s bony fingers pressing down against me. I could feel that robed figure standing at the foot of my bed, whispering something but it was unintelligible over the snarling. Now this is the most fear I have ever felt. At this point my mind began to latch onto logic again and I remembered Sleep Paralysis is a thing. It wasn’t easy but I closed my eyes and began pretending this wasn’t happening until I fell back asleep.</p>
            <p>So there you have it, pretty fascinating what the subconscious mind can do! Next time this happens I’m hoping to be aware enough to greet this being as a friend and see what it’s got to say for itself! I found the book very engaging, due to the similarities of the experiences explained, but no doubt anyone interested in this phenomenon even without experience will enjoy it too.</p>
