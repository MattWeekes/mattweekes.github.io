        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Spiritual Enlightenment sounds like some grandiose state of mind that only monks achieve from a lifetime of dedicated practice, but it is simply to rise above thought. While that isn’t as easy as it sounds and will take years of practice to achieve, anyone can achieve it.</p>
            <p>Most of us struggle with pain, anxiety, depression etc. as we have unknowingly identified with our minds and created a false sense of self. Enlightenment is the realization and transcendence of this. The mind is a powerful tool when used properly, the thing is most people don’t consciously use their mind but are controlled by it. Think about this for a moment by asking yourself: “Who am I?”. If your answers involve things like; possessions, career, social status, education, hobbies, skills, relationships, beliefs, memories, likes and dislikes. Then your mind is identifying with external sources to create your sense of self and these are not <em>you</em>. This is the ego.</p>
            <p>The ego is not your true self, it only exists by external sources. Feeding on past experiences such as memories, and on the future such as who you want to become, to create your ego identity. Identifying with this is a major obstacle to enlightenment, rising above the mind and finding the true self at the core of your being frees you from this.</p>
            <p class="quote">”Identification with the mind which causes thought to become compulsive. To not be able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction, but we don’t realize this because almost everyone is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. This incessant mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness that is inseparable from Being. It also creates a false mind made self that casts a shadow of fear and suffering.”</p>
            <p>It doesn’t make it easy that in today’s society we’re used to so much stimulation. Our minds crave novelty and technology feeds that to no end. The ability to connect with the world so easily, be entertained, solve puzzles, learn new things and everything else the human mind craves is amazing and a great benefit to civilization, no doubt about it. But it’s easy to let it consume yourself. When faced with the idea of paying attention to your own breath for ten minutes - most people resist. It just seems boring and we spend a great deal of time and money to avoid boredom.</p>
            <p>Boredom is something many people complain about, but there is no boredom in the present moment. Boredom is from not being fully attentive to the moment, you are constantly thinking of better things you could be doing but none of them appear satisfying and so you aren’t motivated to do them. Boredom is a pattern, not a reality, and you can train your mind to break free of this pattern.</p>
            <p>Have you ever experienced full awe and beauty when looking at a natural wonder? This comes from the stillness of the mind focused on the present moment. Viewing an amazing mountain stream and being overwhelmed by how wonderful it is, being totally in the present and truly seeing the mountain stream, hearing the water run, feeling entirely at peace.</p>
            <p>A thought exercise: Close your eyes and say to yourself “I wonder what my next thought will be” and then focus and wait for the next thought to pop into mind. Was it a short or long time before a thought appeared? Did you notice a brief moment of stillness before the thought appeared? Meditation practice can prolong that stillness and try to train your mind to find stillness as default rather than follow the chattering mind all the time.</p>
            <p class="quote">”Many people are so imprisoned in their minds that the beauty of nature does not really exist for them. They might say “what a pretty flower” but that’s a mechanical mental labeling. Because they are not still, not present, they do not truly see the flower, don’t feel its essence, its holiness - just as they don’t know themselves, don’t feel their own essence, their own holiness.”</p>
            <p>Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the Now, this can free you from negative emotions. Next time you feel irritation or frustration come to surface, stop for a moment and really focus on that feeling. What are the sensations of the body from this emotion, where is it located, what does this emotion really feel like? You’ll notice that it fades quite quickly, it actually takes a lot of energy to stay irritated. You have to keep reminding yourself the reasons why you’re irritated and cling onto that thought pattern to hold that emotion. Once you let go of that, the emotion fades away too. Imagine being absolutely furious about something, but a friend makes a clever joke and you begin to laugh, that anger subsides and is replaced by joy and laughter. Why is this? Because you are no longer focused on the reasons for anger.</p>
            <p>This is also a powerful tool for physical pain as well. As someone who personally suffers from chronic pain, it has been far more valuable than any medication. I’m not claiming that it removes pain like an opiate would, but the emotional response to physical pain can be separated and that is the worst part. Physical pain is a battle that you are constantly fighting to be rid of, this brings out further emotional response such as frustration, anxiety and depression and taking the time to relax and acknowledge the pain relieves it substantially. Accepting the pain and that it is out of your control brings great relief from the emotional response, the physical pain is still there but it is just a sensation now - the real suffering and unpleasantness comes from the emotional response.</p>
            <p class="quote">”The mind is a superb instrument if used correctly. Used incorrectly, however, it becomes very destructive. To put it more accurately, it is not so much you use it incorrectly - you don’t use it at all. <em>It uses you</em>.”</p>
            <p>Most people are in a constant state of waiting - waiting for a vacation, wealth, a good relationship, some people don’t know what they’re waiting for but they constantly in a state of waiting. One of the noble truths in Buddhism is that existence is suffering. Even in pleasure there is suffering because we know that the pleasure will end. This suffering is from desire, expecting some future event to bring you relief. This future event may bring you joy temporarily, but it will inevitably wear off and you’ll begin chasing the next future goal for relief. True fulfillment is a state of mind that can only happen in the present.</p>
            <p>Living in the present is incredibly good for your well being and overall subjective experience, everyone should strive towards this if even just a little bit.</p>
