        <div class="post-content">
            <p>The Little Prince at first glance appears to be a cute children’s book, but upon reading it you notice that it is full of metaphors outlining the flaws in the human condition. The story follows The Little Prince on his journey from his own small planet as he visits other planets. He leaves his planet to escape from his rose, whom he loves and cares for but has grown vain and needy. Most of these planets are just as small and have one adult living on them, each adult resembles one facet of the flawed side of the human condition.</p>
            <p>On the first planet resides a king, who believes himself as all powerful and always obeyed. The Little Prince feeling homesick, requests a sunset. The all powerful king says he will order the sun to set when the conditions are favourable, which just happens to be right before night time. The Little Prince then states he’s feeling tired and would like to sit, to which the king orders The Little Prince to sit down. Notice the pattern here? The power of the king is an illusion and he is only in power as long as he fools his “subjects”. The same is true of our bosses, authority figures and leaders - they’re ordinary humans, as flawed and fragile as you and I, and they only have the power we believe them to have. The Little Prince, not liking this king, leaves the planet and as a result strips the king of the power he seemed to feel over The Little Prince.</p>
            <p>On the second planet resides a conceited man, dressed in the most fanciful clothing. He asks The Little Prince to clap his hands, as The Little Prince claps the conceited man raises his hat. The Little Prince asks what he must do to make the conceited man lower his hat but the conceited man doesn’t hear him - he only hears admiration. The conceited man demands The Little Prince to admire him some more, not because he has done anything worthy of admiration but because he is so well dressed and so handsome. Vanity and materialism consumes people and inflates their sense of self worth, having the finest clothes and the latest trends doesn’t make one any better than someone who shops at second hand stores. It’s who you are and what you do that makes you worthy of admiration, not what you possess. The Little Prince leaves this planet confused by the attitude of the conceited man.</p>
            <p>The next planet is the briefest visit, on which resides a drunkard. The drunkard is drinking because he is ashamed, “ashamed of what?” asks The Little Prince - ashamed of being a drunkard. This is a sad window into the vices and escapism human seek, self medicating to escape their own personal problems. This only temporarily masks the root cause of the pain one feels, and also creates further problems (such as drinking to stop feeling the shame of drinking too much - creating a vicious cycle). The Little Prince leaves feeling very sad.</p>
            <p>On the fourth planet resides a businessman, who is far too busy to make chit chat with The Little Prince as he must keep counting his stars or else he is a lazy man. Why is he counting the stars? Because that means he owns them, just as if he found a diamond that no one owned he would then own that.<br /> “What do you do with all the stars?” asked The Little Prince - The businessman writes them down on a piece of paper and locks them away in the bank. <br />“And what use is that?” - It makes the businessman rich. <br />”And what use is being rich?” - It means the businessman can buy more stars if somebody were to find more. The Little Prince found that the businessman’s reasoning was similar to the drunkards.</p>
            <p class="quote"> “Quite amusing,” thought The Little Prince. “Rather poetic. But an exercise of no real importance”. The Little Prince’s ideas of about what was important were very different than those of grown-ups.</p>
            <p>On the fifth planet resides a lamp lighter, a man who must light a street lamp at dusk and extinguish it at dawn. The problem is that the planet rotates once per minute, leaving him very little time to rest. He must keep doing this because those are the orders, “orders are orders” he says to The Little Prince. In the beginning the rotation was longer and he had plenty of time to rest between tasks, but the rotation keeps increasing and the orders don’t change. This man represents the pains people experience with modern lifestyles, whether it be work, study or some other ‘necessary’ task. He is ‘forced’ to follow his orders even at the expense of his own personal well being. The Little Prince, realizing he cannot help, leaves.</p>
            <p>On the sixth planet - that is ten times larger than the others, resides a geographer, the geographer never leaves his office. He records all the information about geography such as valleys and mountains, but he has never been outside of his office and experienced these places - that is for explorers, and he is a geographer. The geographer has fallen victim to societies way of boxing us in with specific labels. Having a specialized role and not being allowed to explore other areas of interest to you. The geographer suggests that The Little Prince visits Earth as it has a good reputation.</p>
            <p>The seventh planet, Earth. The Little Prince discovers a whole garden bed of roses and realizes that his rose isn’t as unique as he thought, there are millions of other roses on other planets. While contemplating why his rose is special and different from any other rose he meets a fox and asks to be friends with it. The fox explains that he has to be tamed before they can be friends. The Little Prince asks the fox what tame means. The fox explains that The Little Prince is just a human like any other hundred thousand humans, and he is just a fox like any other hundred thousand foxes. But if he were tamed by The Little Prince, he and The Little Prince would need each other. When The Little Prince needs to leave the fox, the fox becomes sad. The Little Prince wonders what the purpose of a friendship is if it just creates sadness when they have to leave. The fox explains that the friendship has indeed helped him, for before the wheat fields didn’t mean anything to him but now they remind him of The Little Prince’s hair and every time he walks by wheat fields he will have good memories.</p>
            <p>Upon returning to the garden of roses The Little Prince realizes that these roses aren’t anything like his rose at all, his rose is in fact unique and special purely because he tamed that rose - just as that fox is different from the other hundred thousand foxes. He couldn’t see what made his rose special with his eyes, but only with his heart.</p>
            <p>The final encounter The Little Prince has contains a big spoiler for the story, so if you have not read the book I advise that you stop reading here and go do so! It’s fantastic and worth the small amount of time. If you know what happens at the end or simply don’t mind a major spoiler then click to reveal the last part and read on.</p>

            <p class="reveal">The Little Prince meets a pilot stranded in the Sahara Desert, the pilot is in fact the narrator of the story (so the pilot is telling this story as The Little Prince told him upon meeting). After finding a well to drink from, The Little Prince tells the pilot to go fix his plane and come back here tomorrow where The Little Prince will be waiting. Upon returning, the pilot sees The Little Prince sitting atop a wall talking to a snake, the pilot panics and draws his gun but the snake scurries off. The pilot cradles The Little Prince in his arms and can feel his fading heartbeat. The Little Prince explains that he is about to return home to his own planet to care for his rose, and while he may appear dead - it won’t be true. The Little Prince realizes that his body is just a shell of the truth, while the pilot may see him as dead if he looks with his heart he will know that The Little Prince is indeed back on his planet, caring for his rose. The pilot can look up at the stars and see The Little Prince’s planet in sky, twinkling beautifully and remember The Little Prince’s laughter when ever he wishes. While death may appear to be the end, parts of The Little Prince live on in the memories and imaginations of all those that he interacted with on his journey - giving him some degree of immortality.</p>
            <p>In conclusion this book outlines how as we grow up we are molded to fit in with society, to become productive and efficient in lieu of imaginative and curious. We should all try to embrace our inner child as often as we can and rekindle our imaginations and natural curiosity, to try and see the world from a fresh perspective. Don’t get so caught up in what society expects from you - follow your heart and pursue what brings you wonder and passion. Go and tame your own roses and foxes, explore other planets, question the reasoning of others, don’t let society erase your “you-ness”.</p>
