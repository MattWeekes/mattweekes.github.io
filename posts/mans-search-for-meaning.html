        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Viktor Frankl was a psychiatrist and holocaust survivor who spent three years imprisoned in concentration camps. His book covers his experience of one of the darkest moments humanity has faced and the lessons he learned to overcome the suffering. Being both a psychiatrist and a prisoner, he was not only a direct witness to the immense suffering and torture of countless people but a victim of it himself. He observed the effects that these events had on the minds of those around him, as well as his own. The philosophical lessons he has concluded came from a very extreme situation and it is precisely this level of extremity that shows their value to any one, no matter the reason for their suffering.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Everything can be taken from a man but the last of the human freedoms - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”</p>
            <p>A prisoner was stripped of everything that they had - friends, family, all possessions, the clothes they were wearing and even had all the hair on their bodies shaved off. The only thing that distinguished one prisoner from another was the number he was labeled with. Despite all this - as well as being starved, riddled with illness and forced to work in bitter frosts until one dropped dead, one freedom remained that couldn’t be taken away. This was the freedom to choose whether one found meaning in all the suffering and a purpose to fight through, or whether one succumbed to despair.</p>
            <p>The strength of ones will in these situations significantly affected their mortality rate. A man told Frankl of a vision he had that came in the form of a dream, in which he was told that he would be set free on the date of March 30. This man so firmly believed this vision, however, on March 30 he fell quite ill and on March 31 - died. Frankl believes that this is a result that came from the disappointment when his vision didn’t come true, he had given up on a reason to live. A statistic to back up this belief is in the fact that more deaths occurred during the week between Christmas and New Years than any other week. This comes from the idea in many prisoners minds that they will be back home for Christmas, however when Christmas comes and the war is still going - they lose hope, succumb to despair and this weakens them into death.</p>
            <p>Those that believed that life had more to offer, that had a purpose to live through their suffering were the ones that had the best chance of survival. Whether this meaning came in the form of seeing their wives and families again, or needing to go home to finish their “life’s work” that couldn’t be completed by anyone else (this was usually the scientists). If someone believed that they had a purpose in life that was larger than their self, they had the strength of will to push through a seemingly impossible level of suffering.</p>
            <p class="quote">“He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” -Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
            <p>Frankl witnessed people respond to this amount of torture in many different ways. Some sunk down to the level of “swine” where they would become incredibly selfish, to the point of physically beating other prisoners in an attempt to earn the favour of the SS guards. Others would become “saints” - incredibly benevolent, sharing what little bread they were given each day with other, worse off, prisoners. Those that were kind and generous in the face of extreme hardships were giving themselves purpose by helping others. Frankl tells a story of a man he treated for depression, this mans wife had died and he was very upset. He posed a simple question to the man to change his perspective on the entire situation - “What would happen if you had died first and your wife would have had to survive you?”. To which the man replied.<br /> “For her this would be terrible, how she would have suffered!”.<br /> “You see, she has been spared of suffering and it is you that has spared her. At the price that you have to survive and mourn her.” Suffering ceases to be suffering once there is a meaning in the suffering.</p>
            <p class="quote">“When we cannot change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves.”</p>
            <p>The survivors of these camps, freed once the war ended, often pursued their passions and life goals that they otherwise would have been afraid to do due to the likeliness of repeated failures. These fears and failures, contrasted against the tortures that they had to suffer was now nothing to them. Most fears people have today are unimportant, they’re simply barriers they’ve fabricated themselves - the fear of failure, humiliation and outcast of a social circle. We can take a lesson from their experiences, by embracing their outlook on life without having to endure the level of suffering that they had to endure to see this perspective.</p>
            <p>Even in ordinary life, suffering is ever present - as Buddhists will say; suffering is inevitable, it’s just part of the human condition. But how one copes and overcomes their suffering is what defines whether one strengthen and grows as a person or succumbs to self pity and self loathing. If Viktor Frankl were here today he would try and point out a meaning in your suffering, whatever it may be, to show you why you need to cope and endure this and move on to next, better chapter of your life.</p>
            <p class="quote">“So live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!”</p>
