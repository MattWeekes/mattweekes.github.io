            <p>“The New Science of Psychedelics” dives into the research of how psychedelics effect the mind and the many benefits they carry when used correctly. This book mostly focuses on lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin (magic mushrooms). Both of these compounds were brought to the surface in the mid twentieth century. LSD was discovered in 1938 by Albert Hofmann by accident (he was trying to discover a drug to stimulate circulation) but it wasn’t until five years later when Hofmann accidentally absorbed some LSD on his skin that the psychedelic effects were discovered. Psilocybin has been used for thousands of years by countless cultures but it wasn’t until 1955 when an amateur mycologist documented the mushrooms from Oaxaca, Mexico in an article of Life magazine that they became well known to the western world.</p>
            <p>It’s hard to overstate the value these molecules have to us, when they were first being studied in the 1950’s the links to revolutionary understandings of the brain came from LSD. Where tiny quantities of LSD (micrograms - tiny) could invoke symptoms of transcendence, it inspired scientists to search for a neurochemical basis for mental illness rather than the believed psychological which in turn led to the discovered role of neurotransmitters. These substances have profound use in psychotherapy where they have been shown to effectively treat disorders such as: addiction, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorders and eating disorders.</p>
            <p>When using powerful mind altering substances it is very important to have a good “set and setting” - set being a positive mindset and setting being the environment you’re in. This is to ensure a positive experiences comes from the trip which is powerfully influenced by ones expectations. Since the 1990’s when the resurgence of psychedelic therapy research began, over one thousand participants have been dosed with none report any serious adverse effects - <em>set and setting</em> . Another interesting note is that the beneficial effects from these compounds aren’t a direct result of the pharamacology itself but the state of mind that they induce - which can completely dissolve the ego and allow you to see the world from an entirely new perspective (which is very useful for changing undesirable habits, both physical and mental). When these have been used in psychotherapy the data collected reports immensely beneficial experiences, with participants reporting the experience as one of the most meaningful of their <em>entire lives</em>. 66% of participants report it in the <strong>top 5</strong> experiences of their entire lives and 33% of participants putting it at <strong>number 1</strong>. Participants report significant increases to their well being, life satisfaction and positive behaviour changes and when reevaluated over a decade after the experience still report feeling lasting benefits.</p>
            <p>In the 1950’s Sandoz, the pharmaceutical company Hofmann worked for, began sending LSD to clinics and universities across the world to be researched and used in psychotherapy. In the US and Canada, it was shown to have incredible use in curing alcohol addiction - showing an incredible 70% success rate. However Alcoholics Anonymous refused to use LSD, they believed using a drug to cure alcohol addiction would tarnish their reputation and everything that they stood for. LSD was also very successful in treating neurotic anxiety, depression and trauma when used in psychotherapy - showing a success rate higher than 60%. Patients were given a moderate dose, were to lie down on a couch wearing an eye cover with soft music playing. Occasionally the therapist would ask questions or interact with the patient, the state of mind induced in these sessions would lower the defenses of the ego enabling the patient to more openly access memories of trauma.</p>
            <p>Psychedelics also helped birth Silicon Valley in the 1960’s, before it was called Silicon Valley. A man named Alfred Hubbard introduced LSD to many electrical engineers and computer scientists who when trying to revolutionize computers had to think very abstractly and the psychedelic state made that way of thinking more fluid so that they could re-contextualize the abstraction behind computer programming. It gave them a boost in their creative and innovative thinking which led to inventions such as: the computer mouse, graphical computer interface, networked computers and email.</p>
            <p>LSD wasn’t only used as a healing chemical though, the CIA decided to run their own secret experiments on what other uses the chemical could have. Project MK Ultra was the code name for nefarious experiments using LSD as a potential mind control device, a truth serum in torture, spiking water supply to nullify enemies, or dosed to opposing world leaders to make them behave in ways to tarnish their reputations. The CIA would covertly dose government employees, civilians, mental patients, prisoners and sex workers to study their reactions - in one case dosing a mental patient for 174 consecutive days. There’s no surprise that this led to horrific reactions and the experiments continued even after an Army Chemist was secretly dosed, and jumped from a thirteenth story window (there’s much speculation that he was pushed). Amidst the panic of the Watergate Scandal in 1973, the CIA destroyed the files to Project MK Ultra due to its failure to follow informed consent protocol on thousands of subjects and the uncontrolled nature of the experiments that were run. As a result the full impact of MK Ultra and the deaths involved may never be known.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of 1966 psychedelics were made illegal for both recreational and medicinal use, forcing all research the cease entirely or go underground. Santoz handed over their remaining supply of LSD to the US government, leaving the only way to acquire psychedelics through bootleg sources. This, however didn’t stop the CIA and their Project MK Ultra from moving forward trying to weaponize LSD - until 1973 where it was <em>allegedly</em> ended. This book doesn’t delve into the reasons behind why Richard Nixon made these substances illegal and so I’ll leave the politics out of this post as well.</p>
            <p>Our brains have a receptor called the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> also known as the Serotonin <sub>2A</sub> receptor (serotonin also being known as 5-Hydroxytryptamine). These receptors are in large numbers in the human cortex - the outermost and most recent (evolutionary speaking) layer of the brain. The molecular structure of the classical psychedelics resemble the structure of serotonin closely enough that they can attach themselves to these receptors as well. This is an interesting discovery as it leads scientists to speculate that we could produce an endogenous psychedelic that gets released under certain conditions - most popularly a near death experience. The most likely contender for this endogenous psychedelic is DMT (specifically N,N-Dimethyltyrptamine) which is found naturally in the pineal gland of rats and in human cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
            <p>The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a large scale brain network where different regions of the brain interact. This central hub is the default state when there is no demands on our focus but we are in wakeful rest such as; mind wandering, day dreaming, self reflection and worrying. The DMN is oddly enough a highly active state, however when under the effects of psychedelics or in a state of meditation the DMN appears less active, leading researchers to nickname it “the me network” as the DMN is the region that holds our sense of self (also known as our ego) which controls our “time travel thinking”, that is to say, our past and future tense thoughts. Upon further research this could hold major breakthroughs for depression and anxiety, which at the core are a result of our egos being highly negative and too past oriented (depression) or too future oriented (anxiety).</p>
            <p>Because the DMN has higher activity in the central hub, when the DMN is suppressed other areas of the brain gets the excess energy - notably the limbic system, which is responsibly for motivation, emotion, learning and memory. This could explain that while in these altered states of lower DMN someone is more susceptible to emotions and memories (including those of suppressed childhood traumas) making it a valuable psychotherapy tool. The DMN can be thought of as a filter that gives us the state our normal waking consciousness, like a reducing valve that limits what parts of reality we experience into the spectrum of what we need to function and survive. Perceiving too much information all at once can make it difficult to function efficiently - as you’ll notice during the psychedelic experience. When the limbic system crosses with the senses it creates a new perception, incorporating memories into the senses or even crossing the senses over (think synesthesia - hearing colours).</p>
            <p>You may have noticed at random moments in your life where your brain doesn’t take in all the information, instead only the minimum amount to piece together what it thinks is happening. Say for example when you see faces in the clouds or jumping at a shadow you briefly thought was a threat - your brain perceiving a minimal amount of information and eager to interpret, creates a hallucination as a result. Psychedelic hallucinations are created in the opposite manner, that is by temporarily shutting down the “reducing valve” of experience thus receiving excessive information. People who are colour blind report being able to see new colours for the first time on psychedelics, also people report hearing music differently under psychedelics - The timbre and depth of music is perceived in a new light creating a new dimension of musical emotion in the listener.</p>
            <p>Due to the decentralization of brain activity in these altered states, new neural pathways open up. Some form of learning occurs when this happens - people who have taken psychedelics show changes in the personality trait of “openness”. Whether this learning endures after the substance leaves the body depends on if the subject recalls and exercises these new paths after the experience ends (this can be as simple as recollecting the feeling that was experienced or meditating on that feeling). Researches have suggested that the psychedelic experience could facilitate “neuroplasticity” which makes the neurons behind certain patterns and behaviours more “plastic” or easier to change.</p>
            <p>It is common for terminal cancer patients to experience a crisis of meaning after their diagnosis (<em>"Why me?" </em>), under this existential crisis the patients horizon shrinks, their emotional repertoire contracts, and the mind turns its focus inward - shutting out the world and habitually focusing on negative thoughts. Existential distress holds all the signs of a hyperactive DMN and reinforces the neurons behind those negative thought patterns, the ego upon facing it’s upcoming non-existence withdraws investment to the outside world including loved ones. By temporarily dissolving the ego, as seen in the psilocybin studies (but found in the other classical psychedelics too), symbolized by death and rebirth the ego invokes fear initially - but if one can accept and surrender the loss of their ego a powerful flood of positive emotions comes to surface. Not only love for individuals but also love for everything and everyone - the feeling of love and acceptance to being the ultimate meaning and truth. It seems the loss of self leads to a greater sense of universal meaning. Recall that suppression of the DMN takes with it the ego and increases the interactivity with other brain regions that don’t usually directly communicate, forming new lines of connections, do these new connections create a new perspective with meaning? An experiment was performed where a piece of music with no personal relevance was played to volunteers under the effects of LSD. Under this influence, however, the volunteers attributed a lasting personal meaning to that same song. These molecules could help us create meaning if not discover it where no meaning was previously. In an experiment where the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors were blocked with a drug (ketanserin) the LSD attribution of personal meaning was also blocked - leading the researchers to conclude that this receptor plays a role in the generation of personal meaning.</p>
            <p>With the DMN being the seat of the ego, it also brings with it the “time travel thinking” - your sense of self is built heavily on past tense (memories and experiences) and future tense (goals and desires), without these your notion of self can hardly exist. When this way of thinking becomes obsessive, mental illnesses can arise from reinforced neural connections creating habitual negative thinking (as mentioned before; past oriented thinking results in <em>depression</em> and future oriented thinking results in <em>anxiety</em>). Addiction also seems to to involve uncontrollable “time travel thinking” - <q>”When was the last hit, when can I get the next”</q>. These mental illnesses are reinforced by the habitual thoughts that feed and grow them; <em>“This is who I am”, “I don’t deserve to be loved”, “I don’t have the willpower to break this addiction”</em>. The perfect analogy for these reinforcing patterns of thought, and how mystical experiences (psychedelic induced or naturally occurring) can reset the paths in the brain was quoted in the book and is as follows:</p>
            <p class="quote">”Think of the brain as a hill covered in snow, and thoughts as sleds gliding down that hill. As one sled after another goes down the hill, a small number of main trails will appear in the snow. And every time a new sled goes down, it will be drawn into the preexisting trails, almost like a magnet. Those main trails represent the most well-traveled neural connections in your brain, many of them passing through the default mode network. In time, it becomes more and more difficult to glide down the hill on any other path or in a different direction. Think of psychedelics as temporarily flattening the snow. The deeply worn trails disappear, and suddenly the sled can go in other directions, exploring new landscapes and, literally, creating new pathways.” - Mendel Kaelen</p>
            <p>There have been experiments where experienced meditators had their brains scanned while in a state of meditation. Surprisingly the activity map of the brain was very similar to that of an activity map of a brain on psilocybin (that is a suppressed DMN and increased inter-connectivity of other regions). Which seems to imply that these benefits could be achieved through meditation practice, or to create a powerhouse by combining a regular meditation practice with psychedelic assisted therapy.</p>
            <p>It’s important to <em>emphasize</em> that these results are all coming from a formal therapy environment (<strong><em>SET AND SETTING</strong></em>) of psychedelics used in congruence with psychotherapy. The patients had several therapy sessions before introducing psychedelics to ensure it would be a safe session, and many therapy sessions after to integrate the experience into their lives. It is very important to integrate the experience afterwards to ensure the patient internalizes what they experienced, else it becomes just a “drug experience” and they will fall into their old habits. These benefits are reported to be greatly diminished and negative experiences can occur with the incorrect usage of these substances. These substances aren’t miracle cures for these problems and have only been studied as tools used in professional therapy strategies. However the research is looking good, the data shows great potential, and if the path keeps bearing positive results we may finally have an effective treatment for some of the most common mental illnesses prevalent in society.</p>
