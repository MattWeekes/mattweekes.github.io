            <p>Hey! I'm <strong>Matt</strong> but my friends call me <strong>Weekse</strong>.<br /><br />
                I have a passion for music, art and travel. I love reading, plants, 
                animals, computers, video games, archery and learning about anything and everything. I also have a particular 
                interest in the mysteries of the mind. I do graphic design, web development and invest on the stock market 
                for some pocket money to fund all these ventures!

                <h3 class="sub-heading">MUSIC<i class="hobby-fa fas fa-music"></i></h3>
                <p>I play four instruments: Drums, Piano, Guitar and Kalimba. I have an understanding of recording, mixing and 
                    mastering from studying Sound Production. When I'm not playing music, I'll probably be listening to music.

                <h3 class="sub-heading">TRAVEL<i class="hobby-fa fas fa-plane"></i></h3>
                <p>I've explored around: New Zealand, Peru, Japan and the islands of Java and Bali in Indonesia. I prefer 
                    nature to cities and absolutely love seeing the unique landscapes, flora and fauna that the environments have to offer.

                <h3 class="sub-heading">ART<i class="hobby-fa fas fa-palette"></i></h3>
                <p>I play around with watercolours and digital work in Inkscape. Surrealism art is my favourite style favouring the styles 
                    of: Zdzisław Beksiński, Salvador Dalí and Dean Bernardini.

                <h3 class="sub-heading">BOOKS<i class="hobby-fa fas fa-book"></i></h3>
                <p>I read <em>every single day</em>. I lean towards philosophy - particularly on the subject of the mind, consciousness, free will 
                    and the subjective experience of other beings. However a good book on science, biographies, journalism and my 
                    fair share of fiction is found among my collection.

                <p>I gain immesnse satisfaction from watching plants grow. I've got a nice collection of cacti, succulents, 
                    tasty fruit plants and pretty trees. My favourite of which is my Brugmansia tree for its incredible flowers.

                <h3 class="sub-heading">COMPUTERS<i class="hobby-fa fas fa-desktop"></i></h3>
                <p>I've been building my own desktop computers since my teenage years, focusing on high end gaming PC's to 
                    make the most of the gaming experience. Experimenting with available software such as: Photoshop, GIMP, 
                    Inkscape, Cubase and ProTools. I play around with some programming languages, mainly: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP 
                    and Python.

                <p>I've been training in a street defence form of Japanese Jujutsu since 2016. It has improved my self discipline and self confidence
                    while giving me a very useful skill to have (hopefully I'll never need to use it though)!
